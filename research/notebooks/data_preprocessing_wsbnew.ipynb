         "# Here’s a free resource for options trading I created. 60 + lessons that teach everything you need to know to run a good options portfolio.\n\n**Here's the link:**\n\n[https://predictingalpha.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-selling-options/](https://predictingalpha.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-selling-options/)\n\n**Backstory**\n\nA couple years ago I wrote a series on reddit about how to sell options profitably that the community loved. I’ve finally put together a completely free archive of everything I know about options and option selling. \n\nI made this because there's a lot of noise out there around options education, so this is the no BS course I wish existed when I was getting into the space. I tried to make it easy to go through but realistically some of it will be challenging because hey, options are complicated.\n\n**What the course covers:**\n\n* **Basics of how options work -** All the characteristics and important parts of option contracts.\n* **Volatility module** \\- Teaches you how volatility works and impacts option prices.\n* **Learning and interpreting option greeks** \\- Complete breakdowns of each option greek, how they interact with each other and why they matter for your trades.\n* **Skew and term structure** \\- How to think about different strikes and expirations like a professional.\n* **Option selling structures** \\- 4 different ways to structure your trades and how to pick between them.\n* **Trading strategy fundamentals** \\- Basically how to treat your trading like a business and really understand how to extract returns from the market.\n* **How to actually make money** \\- Serious strategy talk. Now that you know how options works, here’s how you actually make some money.\n* **Two  evidence backed strategies that work** \\- A complete guide for selling options on ETFs and selling options around earnings events. Two well known, documented strategies that generate solid returns.\n\n**Disclaimer: I do sell something – but it’s not the course.**\n\nI use reddit too, so I won't hide it from you! The course is 100% free, but I did also build a software company called [Predicting Alpha](https://predictingalpha.com/).\n\nI've been building for 5 years now and pour my heart and soul into it. Its  focused on two strategies: selling options on ETFs and selling options around earnings events, which I think are the two things that retail option sellers should focus on. It handles all the data processing for these strats so that you can extract the premium effectively.\n\nMaybe it'll be of value to you, but if not, the course will definitely be something you love.\n\nAnyways hope you all like the course. Hopefully it levels up our community and we can have some awesome discussions.\n\n\\~ A.G.",

         "NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra chip commercialized",
         "It is learned that NVIDIA (NVDA) and CoreWeave jointly announced that NVIDIA’s next-generation artificial intelligence graphics processor Blackwell Ultra chip has been commercially deployed in CoreWeave.\n\nBlackwell Ultra AI chip officially commercialized  \nAccording to reports, Blackwell Ultra is NVIDIA’s latest chip and is expected to be shipped in batches in the rest of this year. The system installed by CoreWeave uses liquid cooling technology and includes 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 NVIDIA Grace CPUs.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA said that Blackwell Ultra’s ability to generate AI content is 50 times that of its predecessor Blackwell. This announcement is a milestone for NVIDIA. At present, artificial intelligence developers are still scrambling for NVIDIA’s latest chips, and the improvements of these chips make them more suitable for training and deploying models.  \nMarket value approaches 4 trillion US dollars  \nIt is worth mentioning that Nvidia has almost monopolized the market with high-performance AI chips, with annual profits exceeding 500 billion yuan, becoming the “shovel seller” that global technology giants are competing to pursue. It is expected to become the world’s first company with a market value of 4 trillion US dollars. Some analysts even predict that its market value may reach 6 trillion US dollars.\n\n\n\nAs far as global computing power manufacturers are concerned, in the era of generative AI, Nvidia is undoubtedly the one that has gained the most. With the scarcity of high-performance chips and the shortage of supply, it has driven annual revenue to exceed the 100 billion US dollar mark. It is also one of the most profitable technology companies in the world, and has driven its stock price to continue to rise, becoming the world’s highest-valued listed company.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that generative AI is an important driving force for the development of science and technology, and Nvidia is the core driving force of this major technology. Technology giants prefer Nvidia chips to train large models. Technology giants such as Google, Meta, and Amazon have invested tens of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence to purchase Nvidia chips to enhance their own AI capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) has reportedly postponed the release of its most ambitious self-developed AI chips, codenamed Braga-R and Clea, to 2028 or later, and the Maia 200 chip to 2026, with the focus shifted to transitional designs.\n\nMicrosoft released its first self-developed AI chip, Maia 100, last year, and originally planned that Maia 200 would be available in 2025. The slowdown in the launch of self-developed chips may affect Microsoft’s large-scale AI deployment. By replanning transitional designs for 2026 and beyond, Microsoft seeks to maintain progress in the field of custom chips.\n\nObviously, since the beginning of 2025, AI big models have been in full swing, especially the rise of open source models such as DeepSeek R1, which has set off a revolution in the AI ​​industry. The performance of open source models is already comparable to that of top closed source models. Technology giants have started a new round of big model competition to promote AI computing power from laboratories to commercial applications.\n\nWiMi focuses on AI chip technology layout  \nUndoubtedly, AI computing chips have become the focus of global technology competition. According to data, Wimi Hologram Cloud Inc (WIMI), as a cutting-edge technology company focusing on the field of AI chips, focuses on creating “stronger” intelligent computing products by building a diversified technology ecosystem, deploying emerging computing scenarios and promoting industrial collaboration. It has deep technical accumulation and full-stack competitive advantages in chip architecture, cluster system, and software ecology, and has become an important participant in the global AI chip competition.\n\nIn fact, WiMi has long started to deploy the field of accelerated computing, supporting advanced AI chips to build heterogeneous computing platforms, and in terms of edge chip optimization, accelerating the development of low-power, high-compatibility terminal chips, exploring the integration of edge algorithms and AI chips, reducing the cost of small and medium-sized enterprises to access AI technology, breaking through the bottleneck of traditional computing power, and adapting to high-real-time scenarios such as intelligent manufacturing and autonomous driving, injecting surging power into the development of artificial intelligence, and injecting certainty into the computing power base of large models.",

         "Latest numbers crushed expectations. Unit output is up 50%, margins have doubled, and revenue is now pacing toward $20M. With a Made-in-America supply chain, Worksport avoids the new import tariffs that are squeezing offshore competitors. This widens their advantage just as demand accelerates.\n\nSocial sentiment is catching up fast. #WKSP trended top-10 on Twitter all afternoon. Traders are pointing out that the 4.5M-share float can barely handle ETF-sized interest. MarketBeat’s $11.50 to $20.00 target range is being shared across Discord groups as the new bull thesis gains steam.\n\nWhat’s next: SOLIS solar tonneaus and COR battery packs are set to launch this fall, backed by a Fortune 500 pilot. If the core tonneau business pushes into nine-figure sales, analysts say that $20 price target could just be the first stop on a much longer ride.",

Meanwhile, retail traders and Discord groups jumped on the news, pushing #WKSP up the trending charts.\n\nWith industrial adoption in play, fast-growing financials, and a small float, it’s easy to see how WKSP could break into double-digit territory sooner than expected.",
