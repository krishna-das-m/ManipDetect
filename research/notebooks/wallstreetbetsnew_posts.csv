1ltefwz,"Two Special Situations with Near Term Catalysts: $DATS and $HIT;
Two After Hours Market Movers: $MDIA, $CGTX","**After Hours Market Movers--$MDIA, $CGTX--on watch for potential follow through in pre-market Monday.**

**DatChat¬† $DATS $2.62** may be one of those Special Situations that has not been recognized yet by the market-at-large. First, DATS has developed a patented technology which offers users a convenient **Photo Sharing app with User Interfaces (UI) which users can control who views those photos posted in the cloud.** When this app is launched in the next sixty days (as per the CEO in a recent public interview), the potential for the app going explosively viral is very high because users have to set up a digital photo album to be shared with those who have been invited to join that ""album"". **Yes--very unlike Facebook/Meta (FB) in a good way.**

Secondly, DATS owns 34% of a pending IPO of RPM Interactive.¬† that is anticipated--again-- in the next sixty days.¬† **Press Release**:¬† [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/datchat-subsidiary-rpm-interactive-files-121500230.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/datchat-subsidiary-rpm-interactive-files-121500230.html)¬† DATS Current Market Cap is only $12.4 Million--so that low market cap clearly is not taking into account the value of the IPO shares\*\*.¬† A near term catalyst will be the Shareholder of Record Date that will be announced.¬† It would not be a surprise that traders will buy in before the shareholder of record date to participate in the spin out RPM Interactive. ¬† DATS will still be the sole owner of Myseum (the Photo Sharing App).

**Health in Technology $HIT $0.85** This look like another Special Situation/Opportunity. After its IPO in December and running to over $7.50, the stock sold off on massive volume in one (1) day to $1.25 with no news,no new SEC filing no bad press. Don't take my word for it. See the chart-- --[https://stockcharts.com/sc3/ui/?s=HIT¬†¬†](https://stockcharts.com/sc3/ui/?s=HIT%C2%A0%C2%A0) **The company's Cash position is $7.6 million as of March 31, 2025) with the market cap is $47 million, which considering that the company's revenues are growing rapidly--Quarter to Quarter--and reporting Net Income increasing over 257% over the First Quarter, 2024, it looks undervalued.**¬† Revenues increased 56% vs¬† First Quarter, 2024 to $8 Million. HIT CEO Interview was posted two weeks ago--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8KsYEY7ZOQ&t=2039s¬† Corporate Description: HIT's Insurtech platform company, backed by third-party AI technology, offers a marketplace to improve processes in the healthcare industry through vertical integration, process simplification, and automation. By removing friction and complexities, HIT streamlines the underwriting, sales and service process for insurance companies, licensed brokers. Recent Research Report has $2.50 Target Price.

Those who struggle through the darkness‚Ä¶ to make the world a new‚Ä¶ the better angels who create a kinder world for all walks of life no matter where they started‚Ä¶ anything is possible‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt give up‚Ä¶ 

In a world economy of rum‚Ä¶ sugar‚Ä¶ and tea‚Ä¶ built with a force function of slavery‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt inevitable it had to stay in the darkness‚Ä¶ it could change.

None of that will happen‚Ä¶

1lqklhe,Musk‚Äôs xAI received $10 billion in financing,"On July 3, Morgan Stanley posted on the overseas social media X that Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI has completed $5 billion (about RMB 35.8 billion) in debt financing and another $5 billion (about RMB 35.8 billion) in strategic equity financing.



With new financing, xAI‚Äôs valuation exceeded one trillion  
In addition to debt financing, xAI is also negotiating about $20 billion in equity financing, which will value the company at more than $120 billion. The transaction was oversubscribed, and the participants included several well-known global debt investors. The funds raised will be used to develop AI solutions, including the construction of data centers and updates and upgrades to xAI‚Äôs flagship platform Grok.  
It is reported that xAI was founded by Musk in July 2023, and most of the company‚Äôs employees come from giants such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and Tesla. Competition in Silicon Valley has entered a white-hot stage. In order to make it compete directly with ChatGPT, Musk has devoted most of his energy in the past two years to xA. They are already developing the Grok 4 artificial intelligence model.



Amazon releases new AI big model  
At the same time, Amazon (AMZN), a global e-commerce and cloud computing giant, announced on its official website two important milestones in the field of robotics and AI: the launch of a new AI basic big model Deep Fleet, and the number of deployed robots exceeded the 1 million mark.

Recently, Baidu (BIDU) officially open-sourced the Wenxin big model 4.5 series models, covering 10 models such as the mixed expert (MoE) model with 47B and 3B activation parameters and the dense model with 0.3B parameters, and realized the complete open source of pre-training weights and inference code.  
At present, the Wenxin big model 4.5 open source series can be downloaded and deployed on platforms such as the PaddlePaddle Galaxy Community and HuggingFace. At the same time, the open source model API service can also be used on the Baidu Smart Cloud Qianfan big model platform.  
According to foreign media sources, Apple (AAPL) is considering abandoning its self-developed internal model and using Anthropic or OpenAI‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) technology to drive the new version of Siri. People familiar with the matter revealed that Apple has contacted the two companies to discuss deploying their large language models (LLM) on Apple‚Äôs own cloud infrastructure for testing.

WiMi AI industry enters a new stage of application  
At the same time, facing the surging AI wave, data shows that AI visual innovation manufacturer Wimi Hologram Cloud Inc (WIMI) has formed a differentiated competitive advantage with its artificial intelligence large model based on years of technological accumulation, promoting the transformation of large models into inclusive fusion innovation infrastructure, and continuously improving its independent innovation ecology, accelerating the penetration of AI technology into the production end.  
In addition, WiMi promotes the innovation of base large models through an open source model, continuously promotes the development of multimodal large models, supports the fusion analysis of multiple types of data such as voice, image, and video, and plans to launch a higher-precision reasoning model to promote the ‚Äútechnology-data-scenario‚Äù cycle iteration, lower the threshold for use by small and medium-sized enterprises, and provide extensive support for scenarios such as smart manufacturing and smart cities.",text,Independent-Rise-227,kjggaurs,5,1,1751532374.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/1lqklhe/musks_xai_received_10_billion_in_financing/
1lpzhkd,"One Micro-Cap, Two FDA Shots: Colorectal and Pancreatic Early Detection for $1.39","At today‚Äôs $1.39 close, Mainz Biomed offers a two-for-one catalyst package rarely seen below a ten-million-dollar market cap. First, the big one: ReconAAsense, a 15 000-patient colorectal-cancer pivotal built on mRNA biomarkers that already outperformed Cologuard in pilot studies. Interim data drop late next year.



Second, the PancAlert blood test. Discovery work shows 95 percent sensitivity for pancreatic cancer‚Äîa disease with almost no early-detection market entrants. ISB‚Äôs 50-percent grant pays half the feasibility tab, lowering burn and raising odds of a partner deal if numbers hold.



Two independent readouts land within an 18-month window. Any positive headline could double a micro-float trading near cash. And because cash burn (\~$12 million per year) is partly offset by grants and modest ColoAlert EU revenue, dilution between now and the catalysts looks minimal.



Low float, dual trial path, and state money in the bank‚Äî$1.39 feels like optionality priced in pennies.
