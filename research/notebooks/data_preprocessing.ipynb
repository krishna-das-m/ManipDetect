They use what\\'s called a Clearing House, which is where the actual exchange of money for shares happens. Trade settlement happens two days after you execute your trade (T+2), so RobinHood has to keep money on account with the clearing house until the trades settle. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThey have to keep a set amount that\\'s defined by rule (Dodd-Frank), so they don\\'t really get a choice in the matter. They also can\\'t use your money, which is client money - it has to be their own capital. The good news for them is they can net out their exposure, so if you buy a stock but someone sells, the trades net and it\\'s no exposure. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo what the fuck happened here today? Simple. All week, people have been dumping money in and buying more GME. We\\'re all in this together, so nobody\\'s selling and some people are even buying more. The bad news is, because so many people are buying and the price of the stock keeps rising astronomically, RobinHood\\'s margin requirements went WAY up. You\\'ve probably seen the news that RobinHood drew down their credit lines this week ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-app-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-trading-frenzy?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-app-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-trading-frenzy?srnd=premium)), which basically means they had agreements with banks that if they needed to borrow money, they could, and they needed to this week so they did. We literally bought so much of these stocks that RobinHood couldn\\'t afford to cover the requirements for you to buy more. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDoes this absolve RobinHood? FUCK NO. They offer us a service and access to the market, and they sell our order flow to hedge funds, on the premise that they could provide us with that service. They make TONS of money. The fact that they now couldn\\'t afford to deliver on their service is THEIR problem, not ours. They fucked up. They weren\\'t ready to handle this and didn\\'t see it coming, even though it happened right in the open and right in front of them. They made TONS of money on our deal flow but somehow they didn\\'t have enough to pay the margin requirements.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe good news is, this means that they weren\\'t being malicious in trying to shut down buying (note: I\\'m not excusing them liquidating people out of positions, that\\'s a separate issue entirely), just that they\\'re incompetent and inexcusably couldn\\'t handle this volume of deal flow. The bad news is, the issue can absolutely happen again because THIS ISN\\'T FUCKING OVER and WE AREN\\'T DONE HERE. The good news is, with a day of no buy orders in there and trades settling every two days, we\\'ll be back to being able to buy sooner than later. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nToday was a blip and a mistake made by the \"professionals\" who run the infrastructure that serves the system. The hedge funds got lucky and got a breather, a quick day to get out from under the constant barrage we\\'ve put them under. The day is over. We\\'re coming back stronger and harder.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo prevent this from happening again, open brokerage accounts with other brokers who don\\'t have this problem. Spread the love, pay a little more in fees and go get your bags. LET\\'S FUCKING DO THIS!', '2021-01-29 13:43:54')",

It\\'s JUST A GAME to pretend like the bad guys that you don\\'t like will get in a lot of trouble , be taken down , assets seized, of arrested.    We have all seen it for multiple different people these past few years.      Nothing EVER GETS DONE.  \\n\\nAll it is, is angry questionnaires that\\'s go on for hours straight.\\n\\nPolitician: This is a shame what you did, where were you when this happened? \\n\\nThem: I can\\'t really remember that much, but we\\'re looking into at the moment so we can correct these problems in the future. \\n\\nThis is your senate hearing all day for ANYONE the past few years...\\n\\nPaid for Politician: bad bad bad bad bad , did you do this??? DID YOU DO THIS? \\n\\nThem/Corp: I don\\'t have those numbers with me but currently we are working to get it here as soon as possible. \\n\\nPolitician: What about this then? What happened here? Why is this and that happening?\\n\\nThem: I can\\'t remember exactly, I\\'d have to circle back to you.  It might have been an error we later fixed. \\n\\nPaid for Politician: you don\\'t remember ?? You\\'re the top guy , and you can\\'t remember ?\\nI know you did illegal things. Why did you do these things? I have the evidence right here that shows you did this. \\n\\nThem: well,  we were following protocol based on federal guidelines and some team members got confused. \\n\\nPaid for: You know , what you did was wrong, and if we don\\'t fix the actions now, it\\'s going to set a dangerous precedent. Ok next politicians ...\\n\\n\"Politician #2\":. Do you know this X persons on this list?  \\n\\nThem: I dont know\\n\\n#2:. Well they said they know you, and we have multiple communications proving that. \\nWhat you\\'re doing is bad.  \\n\\nThem: I understand, but we were just trying to do the right thing, were already dedicating teams to handle this for the future. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen nothing happens after that. Literally NOTHING.  It\\'s all a Show to keep us occupied and make it look like  things will be done. \\n\\nBUT THEY WONT!  It\\'s all there to quiet the noise down because they are ALL CONNECTED SOMEHOW.      If any normal person was in charge , many people at hearings would be arrested soon after. \\n\\nAfter the hearings you will usually see a series of news articles spread everywhere. A few with \"Senator slams robinhood ceo for...\" In the title, and then it all goes away.   Out of site out of mind. That\\'s the game \\n\\n\\n Now robinhood is coming in tomorrow with a Team of FUD spreaders.  To push other paid for politicians to draft a bill to outlaw speculation.  To tell you speculation on meme stocks should be ILLEGAL for your own good. \\n\\n\\nFUCK everyone on that senate floor tomorrow. \\n\\nThey don\\'t deserve the air they breath.', '2021-03-09 17:30:36')",

BUT! That was 8 straight days of losses before the squeeze happened (Oct 16th - 24th).\\n\\nWhen the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).\\n\\nI know this isn't exactly like the VW squeeze and there are different variables at play but the timeframes still lend to my point... This shit takes time! Everyone expecting this all to happen without any ups and downs need to chill the fuck out.
