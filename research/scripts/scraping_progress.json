      "text": "Merger news impact on PLL? DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT ON THIS STOCK?\nSure! Here‚Äôs a catchy, engaging Reddit post about Piedmont Lithium (PLL) designed to grab attention and spark discussion:\n\nüöÄ Is PLL Poised for a Comeback? Lithium‚Äôs Future Looks Bright‚Äîbut the Stock‚Äôs Still Shaky!\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: demand for lithium batteries isn‚Äôt going anywhere. With EV adoption accelerating globally, I‚Äôm betting PLL‚Äôs fundamentals will shine again soon.\n\nTechnicals show it‚Äôs stuck in a tight range between $6.00 and $6.50‚Äîwaiting for a breakout. Do you think it‚Äôll break up or slip further? Are we looking at a sweet buying opportunity or a falling knife?\n\nAlso curious‚Äîanyone playing PLL calls or planning to? Seems like a sleeper option play right now.\n\nDrop your thoughts and DD below! Let‚Äôs get a real convo going. ‚ö°Ô∏èüîã\n\n",

      "text": "Worksport (WKSP) just locked in a major validation: a top-15 U.S. construction company is actively piloting its SOLIS solar truck bed cover and COR battery nano-grid system. This paid trial comes alongside strong company updates-production surged 50% and margins doubled in recent months.\n\nAnalysts are taking notice too, with consensus price targets around $16.33 and some calling for a possible $20. Meanwhile, retail traders and Discord groups jumped on the news, pushing #WKSP up the trending charts.\n\nWith industrial adoption in play, fast-growing financials, and a small float, it‚Äôs easy to see how WKSP could break into double-digit territory sooner than expected.",

      "text": "Clean-tech skeptics, meet hard proof: a top-15 U.S. construction giant is paying to pilot Worksport‚Äôs SOLIS tonneau and COR nano-grid before launch. That endorsement landed in the same PR that bragged about a 100 %+ margin leap and 50 % production surge. Consensus price target? $16.33, with room to $20. Social buzz followed instantly-Discord rooms lit up and #WKSP surged on Twitter trends. When industrial buyers validate tech and analysts slap a 5√ó upside on a thin float, the transition from single to double digits can happen shockingly fast.",

      "text": "Latest numbers crushed expectations. Unit output is up 50%, margins have doubled, and revenue is now pacing toward $20M. With a Made-in-America supply chain, Worksport avoids the new import tariffs that are squeezing offshore competitors. This widens their advantage just as demand accelerates.\n\nSocial sentiment is catching up fast. #WKSP trended top-10 on Twitter all afternoon. Traders are pointing out that the 4.5M-share float can barely handle ETF-sized interest. MarketBeat‚Äôs $11.50 to $20.00 target range is being shared across Discord groups as the new bull thesis gains steam.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next: SOLIS solar tonneaus and COR battery packs are set to launch this fall, backed by a Fortune 500 pilot. If the core tonneau business pushes into nine-figure sales, analysts say that $20 price target could just be the first stop on a much longer ride.",

      "text": "**After Hours Market Movers--$MDIA, $CGTX--on watch for potential follow through in pre-market Monday.**\n\n**DatChat¬† $DATS $2.62** may be one of those Special Situations that has not been recognized yet by the market-at-large. First, DATS has developed a patented technology which offers users a convenient **Photo Sharing app with User Interfaces (UI) which users can control who views those photos posted in the cloud.** When this app is launched in the next sixty days (as per the CEO in a recent public interview), the potential for the app going explosively viral is very high because users have to set up a digital photo album to be shared with those who have been invited to join that \"album\". **Yes--very unlike Facebook/Meta (FB) in a good way.**\n\nSecondly, DATS owns 34% of a pending IPO of RPM Interactive.¬† that is anticipated--again-- in the next sixty days.¬† **Press Release**:¬† [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/datchat-subsidiary-rpm-interactive-files-121500230.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/datchat-subsidiary-rpm-interactive-files-121500230.html)¬† DATS Current Market Cap is only $12.4 Million--so that low market cap clearly is not taking into account the value of the IPO shares\\*\\*.¬† A near term catalyst will be the Shareholder of Record Date that will be announced.¬† It would not be a surprise that traders will buy in before the shareholder of record date to participate in the spin out RPM Interactive. ¬† DATS will still be the sole owner of Myseum (the Photo Sharing App).\n\n**Health in Technology $HIT $0.85** This look like another Special Situation/Opportunity. After its IPO in December and running to over $7.50, the stock sold off on massive volume in one (1) day to $1.25 with no news,no new SEC filing no bad press. Don't take my word for it. See the chart-- --[https://stockcharts.com/sc3/ui/?s=HIT¬†¬†](https://stockcharts.com/sc3/ui/?s=HIT%C2%A0%C2%A0) **The company's Cash position is $7.6 million as of March 31, 2025) with the market cap is $47 million, which considering that the company's revenues are growing rapidly--Quarter to Quarter--and reporting Net Income increasing over 257% over the First Quarter, 2024, it looks undervalued.**¬† Revenues increased 56% vs¬† First Quarter, 2024 to $8 Million. HIT CEO Interview was posted two weeks ago--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8KsYEY7ZOQ&t=2039s¬† Corporate Description: HIT's Insurtech platform company, backed by third-party AI technology, offers a marketplace to improve processes in the healthcare industry through vertical integration, process simplification, and automation. By removing friction and complexities, HIT streamlines the underwriting, sales and service process for insurance companies, licensed brokers. Recent Research Report has $2.50 Target Price.\n\n*Due diligence is always necessary to make informed investment decisions. So take these ideas as a starting point and not your entire due diligence effort.*",
